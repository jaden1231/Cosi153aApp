# Cosi153aApp
The app is called Biz Sim. An abbrievated version of "Business Simulator" 

A game the user can play offline, or whenever on the go, about buying businesses and investing. 
The user can constantly increase their money counter, and buy fictional businesses to increase their passive income. 
Different businesses can be pricier to purchase, but increase the money counter by a higher factor. With a neat layout
of images with colored buttons for the businesses, that can scroll horizontally. A basic About Page and Preferences, 
but most of the app is self-contained to a single screen, keeping the user's interest. 

[Developer Notes]
Use of Basic reactNative functions, Text, Image, Button, TextInput, etc

Use of UseEffect and UseState in the main screen for 
the realtime moneycounter increase
(displayed in bright green text)

Use of FlatList for the horizontal row of business cards, 
which is scrollable and can thus be lengthened indefinitely

Use of Alert for Dark Mode Feature, to notify user. 
Dark Mode in the works still

Google Docs API in the works, but trickier, 
so use of offline stored Data for business objects
